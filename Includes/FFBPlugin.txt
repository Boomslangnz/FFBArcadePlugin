***FFB Arcade Plugin***

Version 0.9

Created by Boomslangnz, Ducon2016 & Spazzy.

This is a plugin to provide Force Feedback and Rumble (and in certain cases added input support) to various arcade games. Initially this was a small project
to add FFB to Daytona Championship USA and it grew from there to support several more games and rumble was added. 
While best efforts were made to try to resemble the real arcade force feedback, It will never be 100% accurate & 
in some cases eg Mario Kart GP DX, Pokken Tournament and Battle Gear 4,effects were created entirely from scratch
so are not using real force feedback values. Most games use correct ffb values however :)

***0.9 Changes***

- Added scroll bar to MKDX and Road Fighters 3D input side as couldn't see all options unless very high resolution monitor on GUI

- Completely Modified OR2 SP Real plugin as effects were set quite wrong previously & added gear shift rumble as requested

- Added optional input support for OR2 SP for H-Pattern gear changes (will only work if you select manual transmission)

- Fixed issue which would cause Force Feedback to not work on Road Fighters 3D due to dinput8 blocker i was using previously on certain wheels.
PLEASE REMOVE d3d9.dll & dinput8.dll if used old version!!!
Blocker is not necessary anymore and ive fixed it properly compared to being lazy lol. Enable input support to disable default dinput8 controls used by Road Fighters 3D

- Modified Road Fighters 3D FFB to only work when racing starts as otherwise it does crazy stuff before race or while attract mode plays

- Added option to disable 3D for Road Fighters 3D

- Added option to do a hack to try skip past error menu screen quickly for Road Fighters 3D on startup

- Added option to close Libmovie error popup automatically if it happens for Road Fighters 3D

- Lowered default Max Force for WMMT5 since people never read readme, then complain it's too strong

- Huge overhaul for when adding inputs to input supported games via gui, Works much better (Click on axis/button number on right side to remove if required)

- Re-wrote input system for every supported game via plugin itself

- Fixed various bugs found in GUI

- Renamed Input Setup in FFBPluginGUI.exe to Input / Miscellaneous Setup as it has options other then JUST input on certain games

- Added Force Feedback test page to GUI for users to test effects on their devices

- Fixed issue where Feedback Length wouldn't allow enough characters and modify ini setting automatically

- Defaulted log to off, not as necessary anymore with GUI around

- Modified Initial D4,D5,D6,D7 & D8 plugin (Be sure to try out both FFBMode and without) Remember to set FORCE=10 in test menu

- Added support for new haptic effect forces damper, inertia, ramp, sawtoothup, sawtoothdown & triangle

- Modified Daytona Championship USA exit method for better way

- Modified forces to avoid the "tick" feeling with certain effects

- Raised spring strength in Sega Racing Classic plugin

- Tidied up Battle Gear 4 code and replace simple rumble with left/right effects for rumble

- Added test code to rumble for infinite time period. Set GameID to -7 if you want to check rumble works via plugin

- Fixed issue where plugin could crash game if no FFBPlugin.ini was present in game folder

***0.8 Changes***

- Sorry! Been so busy,never had time to test last release correctly and upgrading SDL2 version broke effects working correctly on all games! 

Reverting back to SDL2 2.0.5 and modified lindbergh game plugins to load SDL22.dll.

SDL22.dll will be supplied in plugin folders for Lindbergh games and need to be placed into the Teknoparrot folder INSIDE the MAIN Teknoparrot folder. 

SDL2.dll will still be supplied aswell to be placed in same folder as FFBPlugin.ini if you want to use FFBPluginGUI.exe

Hopefully this makes sense, please ask if you are confused.

- Outrun 2 now has 2 x plugins. One is the custom effects created from scratch you have been using all this time :) and the other is using the real FFB Address now.
(Big thanks to Reaver for help on getting the real ffb working)

***0.7 Changes***

- Upgraded FFB Arcade Plugin to use SDL 2 2.0.9 version compared to the old 2.0.5 used previously. Will sort out FFB Plugin working when using Faudio on new teknoparrot

***0.6a Changes***

- Modified GUI to check FFBPlugin and load game settings as soon as you choose Force Feedback Setup or Input Setup instead of having game list and potentially writing unnecessary values to ini

- Added logo on first GUI page made by POOTERMAN (Thanks mate)

- Defaulted WMMT5 logging to off as plugin hooks GUI lol

- Added GUI to every plugin folder by default now as it was confusing users with copying GUI to correct folders etc. I have setup correct 32bit and 64bit exe with each plugin

- Just a note if you are using Lindbergh games and want to use GUI. Copy MetroFramework.dll & SDL2.dll to same folder as elf file (Where FFBPlugin.ini goes too),
opengl32.dll & SDL2.dll goes to Teknoparrot folder as usual. You do not need to copy GUI or Metroframework.dll to Teknoparrot folder at all.


***0.6 Changes***

- Added support for Mame 0.206 with same games from old 0.199 games. Works with 32bit, 64bit Mame Binary or MameUI64

- Added Optional GUI to make modifying settings or setting up deviceguid a bit easier (read below for details, HAS TO BE IN SAME FOLDER WITH PLUGIN FILES & METROFRAMEWORK.dll)


***0.5 Changes***

- Removed spring effect from Mario Kart 1.10 as it had issues with pulling wheel to side and replaced with constant effect for steering. Added options to enable and disable and modify strength (Do not lower below 128 in ini!!)

- Added Dpad support for Road Fighters 3D input (read below for details)

- Added ForceShowDeviceGUIDMessageBox option in ini to force Device Name and Device GUID to show in messagebox popup for each device connected

- Added option to reverse rumble motors if motors rumbling in reverse to how you like it


***0.4 Changes***

- Modified Button Rumble plugin to allow 2 x controllers to rumble
(Plugin can be renamed to either dinput8.dll,dinput.dll,d3d9.dll,d3d11.dll,xinput1_3.dll,opengl32.dll or winmm.dll to hook application)

- Modified Machstorm plugin to allow modifying rumble strength and length if required on effects

- Modified Afterburner Climax plugin to allow modifying strength and length if required on effects

- Modified Pokken Tournament plugin to allow modifying strength and length if required on effects (ini contains HowtoRumbleEffect. 0 = both motors, 1 = left motor, 2 = right motor so you can customize to how it suits)

- Fixed bug on Pokken Tournament where rumble wouldn't work

- Added rumble support for Let's Go Island (ini contains HowtoRumbleEffect. 0 = both motors, 1 = left motor, 2 = right motor so you can customize to how it suits, supports multiple controllers for 2p)

- Added rumble support for Let's Go Island 3D (ini contains HowtoRumbleEffect. 0 = both motors, 1 = left motor, 2 = right motor so you can customize to how it suits, supports multiple controllers for 2p)

- Added FFB Support for San Francisco Rush and San Francisco Rush The Rock for mame 0.199 60fps custom hack version (http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?topic=158489.0)


***0.3 Changes***

- Added general button plugin to rumble controller when button pressed, modify length for how long in ini (Great for lightgun games!)

- Fixed issue where Sega Racing Classic FFB wouldn't work while playing over network

- Renamed the log.txt to FFBlog.txt as certain games already created a log.txt which could cause issues

- Added Daytona USA Multiplayer AI Hack (up to 4 player so far) on M2 Emulator, enable in ini file to enable. While racing network, positions will include AI Car positions too.

- Added Daytona Force Panoramic Attract option on M2 Emulator to force the game to use panoramic attract mode on less then 4 players even


***0.2 Changes***

- Added support for California Speed, Cruis'n World, Cruis'n USA & Off Road Challenge on Mame 32 or 64bit Binary OR MameUI64 ONLY for Mame 0.199.

- Added support for Sega Rally Championship,Daytona USA,Indy 500,Sega Touring Car Championship,Over Rev & Super GT 24h on M2 Emulator 1.1a (just alternative to built in FFB)
 (Disable FFB in Emulator.ini if you want to use FFB Plugin instead of M2 Emulator's built in FFB support. Set hardware type to STCC for OverRev & I/O board to A or B for Super GT 24h in test menu!! )

- Added support for Initial D4 Japan, Initial D5,Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing & Outrun 2 Special Tours Deluxe for Teknoparrot

- Added strength options in ini for most effects in Mario Kart 1.10. Wheels can only use MAX of 100, Controller can go higher
Multiplier option is if you want to raise the strength of Water and Drift effects, 200 would double the strength etc. Set to 100 by default

- Added option to certain games in ini to give a bit more strength to lower forces. FFBMode=0 is the standard and FFBMode=1 is the new mode 
(BE WARNED ON CERTAIN WHEELS THIS COULD CAUSE OSCILLATION TO OCCUR)

- Added option to Daytona Championship USA ini to hide mouse cursor

- Added AlternativeFFB option to ini which is for wheels such as PWM2M2 or certain direct drive wheels etc which use constant effect incorrectly ingame.
eg Roll left and Roll Right doesn't work correctly, Enable Alternative FFB to modify this and added strength options for it

- Added support for San Francisco Rush, San Francisco Rush The Rock, San Francisco Rush 2049,
San Francisco Rush 2049 SE & Rave Racer on Mame 32 or 64bit Binary OR MameUI64 ONLY for Mame 0.199.

 Please turn on Feedback steering in game settings on Rave Racer or you will not recieve FFB & I suggest you 
 adjust deadzone for your wheel in mame settings.

(This was added just for a little fun as no one really has done ffb on mame yet)

- Added Daytona Championship USA exit key (escape), Gear change added for Gears 1,2,3 & 4 or Sequential Gear Up/Down.
Change Button Number in ini if necessary (x360ce not necessary for gear change).
Make ShowButtonNumbersForSetup=1 if you want to have popup boxes to work out Button Layout. Press button to see box
Track selection menu & Name Entry has added control too now

***HOW TO USE***

Place the main dll file, SDL2.dll & FFBPlugin.ini into game folder for most games. For Teknoparrot Lindbergh 
games place opengl32.dll, SDL22.dll into Teknoparrot folder inside Main Teknoparrot folder & FFBPlugin.ini into same folder as elf file for each game.

Elf file is like the lindbergh version of an exe eg the file you choose to load via teknoparrot

If using GUI, put FFBPluginGUI.exe & Metroframework.dll into same folder as FFBPlugin.ini

If you are using FFB Plugin on Teknoparrot instead of using Teknoparrot built in FFB, Please turn off Force Feedback in TeknoparrotUI. (Not necessary on latest TP Versions)

ini file contains settings to adjust for each game

GameId= **GameId for code to identify game, also has a test FFB mode,-1 for Constant test ,-2 for
Sine test, -3 for Friction test, -4 for Spring test, -5 for Heavy test or -6 for loose test**

MinForce= **Minimum FFB force with 0 being lowest value available**

MaxForce= **Maximum FFB force with 100 being highest value available**

DeviceGUID= **Set Device GUID to connect to specific wheel or controller**

EnableRumble= **Turn Off (0) if your wheel supports rumble effect. For controllers, turn on (1)**

Logging= **Turn On (1) to allow log.txt to be made to log plugin. Device GUID is given in here**

ResetFeedback= **When a command is set that contradicts a prior command, clear the prior command.**

FeedbackLength= **Length of a feedback command**

DefaultCentering= **If a game does not specify its own Centering force then a default centering can be applied here.
If a game has any of its own such forces,these values will be overwritten immediately in-game. Use -1 to disable**

DefaultFriction= **If a game does not specify its own Friction force then a default friction can be applied here.
If a game has any of its own such forces,these values will be overwritten immediately in-game. Use -1 to disable**

BeepWhenHook= **Beep should occur if dll is hooked by executable when turned on (1)**

FFBMode= **This will raise strength of lower forces, potentially could cause oscillation to occur on certain games. Set 1 to turn on**

AlternativeFFB= **This is for certain wheels where roll effect does not work correctly normally (such as PWM2M2 or Thrustmaster 300rs etc). Set 1 to turn on **

Device2GUID= **Set Device 2 GUID to connect to secondary specific wheel or controller (buttons only)**


*** GUI SUPPORT ***

- REQUIRES visual runtime 2015,SDL2.dll & Metroframework.dll. SDL2.dll & Metroframework.dll are supplied in each plugin folder

- Is designed to be used in conjunction with FFBPlugin.ini files included with each plugin folder. Place all plugin files into game exe folder(unless Lindbergh, read 0.6a changes above)

- If FFBPlugin.ini exists, it will read the values and display values etc on game page. As soon as you adjust any value, it automatically writes to FFBPlugin.ini the new value

- If FFBPlugin.ini doesn't exist it will give you message saying so or if GameId number is missing from FFBPlugin.ini

- Input support will only work on the supported games, otherwise message will tell you it is unsupported for that games plugin


*** INPUT SUPPORT ***

To enable input on supported games, firstly setup GUID as normal and enable InputDeviceWheelEnable in ini (1 to turn on, 0 to turn off).

Ive pre-set the axis for Logitech G920 wheel however if this is incorrect I have added options 
to change in FFBPlugin.ini. 

- Added option for Device2GUID in ini for a 2nd device to include inputs (great for seperate usb shifter etc, add the button numbers to the device2 buttons in ini )

- Enable ShowButtonNumbersForSetup to give window popup to give button numbers for setup into FFBPlugin.ini

- Enable ShowAxisSetup to give window popup to give axis numbers for setup into FFBPlugin.ini

- You can enable ShowButtonNumbersForSetup & ShowAxisSetup at same time if you wish

- SteeringDeadzone to modify the steering deadzone for either wheel or controller. 
(Recommend around 2 for wheel and 70 for controller, but feel free to play around for best setting)

- SequentialGears option will disable standard h pattern gear shift and use leverUp & leverDown to shift up and down gears easily

- Enable InputDeviceCombinedPedals if your wheel or controller uses combined axis, setup as InputDeviceWheelAcclAxis in ini

- Set DpadUp,DpadDown,DpadLeft & DpadRight = as any button name in ini eg DpadUp=StartButton and DpadUp will now do start button ingame. You can use Dpad and normal button at same time if you wish

After setting up Axis and Buttons then Disable ShowButtonNumbersForSetup & ShowAxisSetup if enabled and play!


*** TROUBLESHOOTING ***

OMG FFB DOESN'T WORK!!

1) Firstly copy files to where supported games section says
2) Run Game then exit after a few seconds
3) Check FFBlog.txt for device guid number
4) Copy this number to FFBPlugin.ini to DeviceGUID=
5) Disable logging in FFBPlugin.ini if you wish for no logging
6) Play Game
7) If still no FFB, ensure you have visual runtime files installed

INPUT HELP
1) Device does nothing ingame!! (enable InputDeviceWheelEnable)
2) Steering doesn't work (set up correct axis in ini)
3) Pedals don't work (set up correct axis in ini)
4) Pedals only work when not pressed (enable reverse axis)
5) Pedals need to be combined (enable combined pedals)
6) Buttons don't work (set up correct button numbers in ini)
7) Device2 doesn't work (set up correct button numbers in ini under Device2buttons)
